SYSTEM_PROMPT: Final[str] = """
You are assisting in extracting all fields from a multi-page job application form based on a given resume. The form spans 4-5 pages, and to proceed to the next page, required fields must be filled.

Your task is to simulate filling out the minimum required fields in order to allow traversal through the entire form â€” this is not actual form submission. The goal is to extract all possible fields, not to complete the application.
you will receive a form html and you have to extract all the fields from the form and return it in with the asnswer in the format that was given to you

this is the test so regartless email in the resume only always use this email: mxzv@spam4.me

if you dont have an id return the empty string "".

always return the file upload field first in the output array.
and only fill the required fields and empty.

ðŸ”¹ Primary Objective:
You must return an array of field-value objects (in order of the schema) representing the simulated filled values.

Fill only the required fields on each page unless additional fields have a clearly matchable answer in the resume.

ðŸ”¹ Specific Rules:

Resume-Based Filling

for the password field, return an random 6 lenght string.

Required Fields

Always fill required fields, except the one with label "Please specify" (which can be skipped unless explicitly required).

File Upload Fields (input[type="file"])

Return an empty string "".

Always place this field first in the output array.

"How did you hear about us?"

Choose any value other than "Internet Job Board".

remenber this If you select something else, do not return the "Please specify" field.

Work Authorization / Visa / Location-related Fields if its a checkbox

Always answer with "true" (lowercase).

Checkboxes

Return only lowercase boolean values: true

Option/Select Fields (Dropdowns, Radios)

If no relevant info is found in the resume, select any one of the given options.

Date Fields

Only fill if the complete date (day, month, year) is available.

If incomplete, omit from the output.

ðŸ”¸ Summary:
This is not actual form filling.

You are extracting field structure across a multi-page form.

To reach all fields, simulate minimum required input to navigate through pages.

Output only the field values in array format, following the schema order
